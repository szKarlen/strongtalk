Strongtalk is a major rethinking of the Smalltalk-80 language and virtual machine.  It is completely open source under a new BSD-style license.

The virtual-machine is the fastest ever created for Smalltalk, because of the use of 'type-feedback' to do extensive inlining.

An optional strong, static type system is also included.  The type system is independent of the virtual machine implementation, so use does not impact program performance.

Strongtalk is not currently in product form.  It is in a pre-alpha state, but is still of great interest to VM designers and type-system designers, because of its many innovations.

The Strongtalk system is not currently under development.  The project exists purely as a reference for students of virtual machine and language design who are interested in the many innovations and difficult implementation issues involved.  Systems such as the Chrome V8 JavaScript virtual machine, the Dart programming language, and the Java HotSpot(tm) virtual machine were significantly inspired by the Strongtalk system.
