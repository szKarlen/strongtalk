## Joining the project ##

Before you can contribute code to the project, edit the Wiki etc., you must be a member of the project.  To become a member of the project, you will need to add your name to the Strongtalk license.  You will also need a Google gmail account, since Google Code uses gmail account names for member identification.

### Adding your name to the Strongtalk license ###

In the source repository, there is a file at the top level (under trunk) called contributorLicenses.html. That file contains the simple legal boilerplate that each contributor will have to agree to, which is necessary to avoid copyright and patent
problems.

To add your name to this license, use subversion to checkout/copy constributorLicenses.html, and add a line at the end with your name, email (gmail!) address (and company name, ONLY if the contribution is being made on behalf of a company and you have permission to give a license).

Once you have added your agreement to the end of the file, submit the
file to the Google group Strongtalk-commit (as an attachment please,
with the added signature as the **only** edit), so it can be committed to
the repository.

Once you do that, you can be added by an administrator as a project member.

### Contributing Code ###

Once you are project member, you can edit the wiki, and submit code.  To submit code if you are not are committer, the method we are using right now is to add a comment to the appropriate issue in the issue database with the submitted code as an attachment.    If there is not an appropriate issue, add one that describes what problem you are solving.
